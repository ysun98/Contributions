Update the following URL to point to the GitHub repository of
the package you wish to submit to _Bioconductor_

- Repository: https://github.com/ysun98/demo

Confirm the following by editing each check box to '[x]'

- [ x] I understand that by submitting my package to _Bioconductor_,
  the package source and all review commentary are visible to the
  general public.

- [ x] I have read the _Bioconductor_ [Package Submission][2]
  instructions. My package is consistent with the _Bioconductor_
  [Package Guidelines][1].

- [ x] I understand that a minimum requirement for package acceptance 
  is to pass R CMD check and R CMD BiocCheck with no ERROR or WARNINGS. 
  Passing these checks does not result in automatic acceptance. The 
  package will then undergo a formal review and recommendations for 
  acceptance regarding other Bioconductor standards will be addressed.

- [ x] My package addresses statistical or bioinformatic issues related
  to the analysis and comprehension of high throughput genomic data.

- [ x] I am committed to the long-term maintenance of my package. This
  includes monitoring the [support site][3] for issues that users may
  have, subscribing to the [bioc-devel][4] mailing list to stay aware
  of developments in the _Bioconductor_ community, responding promptly
  to requests for updates from the Core team in response to changes in
  _R_ or underlying software.

I am familiar with the essential aspects of _Bioconductor_ software
management, including:

- [ x] The 'devel' branch for new packages and features.
- [ x] The stable 'release' branch, made available every six
      months, for bug fixes.
- [ x] _Bioconductor_ version control using [Git][5]
  (optionally [via GitHub][6]).

For help with submitting your package, please subscribe and post questions
to the [bioc-devel][4] mailing list.
